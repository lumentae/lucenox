I started working on the schematic, which I got done quickly but I needed to research how keyboard matrices work and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LyziNdFlew) video by Joe Scotto.

After 3h of brainstorming and designing the schematic, I moved on to the pcb.
This is what took me the longest because I tried to route it manually.

Today I remembered that I have Freerouting installed, so I used it for it's autorouting feature and it saved me many hours of painfully placing vias and routes

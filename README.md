# Lucenox

**Lucenox** — *Light in the Darkness*

---

## Overview

Lucenox is a custom mechanical keyboard with hotswappable switches which was inspired by the QWERTZ layout. It also features per key RGB with QMK!

---

## Reason

I made the project just for fun and to see if I could build my own keyboard, because I wanted something that felt exactly like my current keyboard, but in a smaller size.
Also I currently use a membrane keyboard and I thought that highway could give me an opportunity to learn how mechanical keyboards work and switch to a mechanical one.

## Technical Details

- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico 
- **Firmware:** QMK
- **Connectivity:** USB wired connection
- **LEDs:** SK6812 RGB underglow LEDs with individual addressability
